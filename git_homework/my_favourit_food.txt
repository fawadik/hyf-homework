What is Butter chicken?
Chunks of grilled chicken (tandoori chicken) cooked in a smooth buttery & creamy tomato based gravy is known as Butter chicken or murgh makhani. It was invented by Kundan lal Gujral, who was the owner of a popular restaurant named Moti Mahal in Delhi.

The restaurant which had large orders of TANDOORI CHICKEN throughout the day would typically end up with lot of leftovers which were turned into this amazing rich gravy the next day.

To make an authentic butter chicken recipe, First we need to grill the chicken. This can be done either in a pan, tandoor or oven. Next cook it up in the rich gravy. The recipe shared in this post is an authentic one, except grilling in tandoor.

Not every one of us would be able to grill chicken in a tandoor or in a oven. So for this post I have done it in a pan. If possible you can follow the dungar method to smoke the chicken once it is roasted on a pan.
